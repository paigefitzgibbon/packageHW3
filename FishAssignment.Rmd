## Fish Assignment

### Part 1. Generate example data

```{r}
# ----- Fish Prices ----- #

fish = c("Cod", "Salmon", "Steelhead", "Tuna", "Shark", "Sole")
price = c(34.89, 26.66, 15.41, 13.84, 58.66, 63.96)
fish_price = data.frame(fish, price)
fish_price$fish = as.character(fish_price$fish)

# ----- Fish Catches by Location ----- # 

locs = c("location1", "location2", "location3")
fish_catches = matrix(nrow = length(fish), ncol = length(locs), 
                      dimnames = list(fish, locs)) 

for ( i in 1: length(fish)) {
  for (j in 1:length(locs)) {
      fish_catches[i,j] =  sample(1:100, 1)
  }
}

```

### Part 2. Run the function

```{r}
fisheries(fish_price, fish_catches, showplot=FALSE)

fisheries(fish_price, fish_catches, showplot=TRUE)
```


#Show an example of using your growth rate function with parameters from Experiment A of Table 2 in Bjoornsson et al., 2007
```{r}
library(Homework3)
help(fishgrowth)
fishgrowth()
```
